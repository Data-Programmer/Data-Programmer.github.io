- news: "In light of recent events, I've decided to finally publicize my business, AppTana, LLC. My goal is to serve small businesses in Montana, eventually expanding to service neighboring regions. Having now worked for two employers in a row with poor management, I will strive to provide better for my future employees. I will no longer allow other people to dictate my success. Instead, I intent to follow my own path. If I am to fail, then at least I can take comfort in knowing that I did everything in my power to attempt success. I've grown tiresome of other people dictating success for me."
